Overview
- build graph of node and edges
- compute layout properties of nodes and edges (relative coordinates)
- render layout into page

ToDo
- properly space branches by not limiting y coordinate calculation to immediately preceding node
- hasAncestor method in Nodes for subtree/branch search (goal condition of search end)
